        <h2>Why Wilmington University?</h2>
        <p>Since I was a kid, I've always had a love to computers and technology. Since elementary school, my favorite classes were centered around computers. Wilmington University was one of the
          first colleges that came up during my search. </p>
        <p> During my time at WilmU I was able to learn more about computers, languages, and software. Since I first started I Wilmington University, I have learned about, and gained more confidence in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, Python, Java, SQL, PHP, Excel and creating/managing databases. </p>
