    <h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>
    <h5>Why did I create this site?</h5>
    <p> I wanted to challenge myself to create an entire website from the ground up. In doing so I hope to portray some of the skills and knowledge I gathered throughout my time at WilmU.</p>
    <h5>What will happen after graduation?</h5>
    <p>Following graduation, I plan to continuously expand, refine, and improve upon this website with the knoweldge and skills I gain from hands-on experience throughout my career, along with the certifications I pursue. </p>

    <p>Looking back, I am fully grateful and appreciative of the opportunities offered to me throughout my education. 
      Since my first day, I feel that I have grown to be well versed across multiple langauges. I have gained hands-on experience with object-oriented programming, as well as experience
      with mobile app development and web design.
